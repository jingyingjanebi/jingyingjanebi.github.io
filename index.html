	    My research interest lies on quantitative investment, machine learning, natural language processing
	    and network economics. 
	    I received Master’s degree from the University of Chicago. My Master’s thesis 
	    <i>News Diffusion Through Online Social Network</i> 
	    won the Data Science Awards on 
	    <a href = "https://mindbytes.uchicago.edu/">Mind Bytes 2018 - Research Computing Expo and Symposium</a>.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    I enjoy painting, Chinese calligraphy, reading, yoga and sports. My paintings
	    <i>Yolmo - Art of Basket Weaving</i>
	    were distributed by Dr. Lauren Gawne to Yolmo villagers in Nepal.
	    We hope more people discover the beauty of Yolmo culture.
	    <br>

	    I am passionate about educational equity. I was a teaching volunteer in Nakhon-Pathom, Thailand, teaching English to over 600 students from Kindergarten to Grade 9, in 2014. 
	    I am a member of <a href = "https://www.jstart.org/">JumpStart</a> in Chicago, IL, working on early education. 
	    I also taught at Chicago public school <a href = "https://www.kenwoodacademy.org/">Kenwood Academy</a>, in 2018.
