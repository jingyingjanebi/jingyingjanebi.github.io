					    <strong>Stocks Portfolio Design with Numbers and Text Dataset</strong>
				    </a>
			    </h5>
			    <p>
				    This paper designed a portfolio consisting of stocks which are “wonderful business at bargaining price with high momentum and great industrial leadership”. Firstly, I created a raw portfolio of 26 stocks selected through Portfolio 123. Then, I conducted sentiment analysis on 3,279,343 Reuters news with various statistical models to predict the performance of each single stock in future. With 21 promising stocks in gaining positive inflation-adjusted excess return, I further shortlisted 9 of them to make up of ultimate portfolio. These nine stocks have the least correlations among each other. The actual performance of the ultimate portfolio beat both the raw portfolio and the market benchmark in future.

				    <strong>News Diffusion Through Online Social Network</strong>
			    </h5>
			    <p>
				    Today, false news diffuses at an unprecedented speed through online social networks. Such news causes unnecessary chaos or panic and might even post a threat to our democracy. I collected the 45,181 Tweets (including Retweets) containing both identified true and false news via Twitter APIs. I then analyze their diffusion patterns and study their relationship to the engaged users’ characteristics. I find that false news diffuses significantly faster, deeper and broader than the true news. Moreover, regardless of its veracity, news spreads faster while being circulated by users who have less followers but more friends and post fewer Tweets but more likely to “like” other users’ posts. Furthermore, I find that the Twitter community can recognize false news and correct it over time. Three distinct false-correction features are identified, namely concurrent, gothic and camel. Examining these features could help discover and curb false news.

				    <strong>Stock Market Prediction with Reuters News Archive 2007 ~ 2018</strong>
			    </h5>
			    <p>
				    This paper aims at predicting asset prices. It uses both numbers and text dataset with various statistical models such as linear regression, LASSO, partial least squares (PLS), principal component analysis/regression (PCA/R), CART Tree, random forest and averaging modeling. Except SP500 historical prices, CPI, and Fama-French 3 factors, all the dataset used in this paper were constructed by the author. Most numbers variables are newly derived from the prices, CPI, and so on. Text data were scraped from Reuters online news archive. 3,279,343 Reuters news were collected, which covers since Jan 1st, 2007 to Apr 29th, 2018. The results show that random forest has the best explanatory power, while CART Tree has the best predicting power with low out-of-sample R2 (OOS R2).

				    <strong>Quantitative Analysis of the Global Financial Crisis in The Economist</strong>
			    </h5>
			    <p>
				    I studied the full dataset of publications in The Economist from 2006 to 2010 to inspect how the articles in different sectors as well as different regions/ countries take response to the Global Financial Crisis. I explored how the responses compare and contrast with each other by looking at the inner sector semantic environment, the cross-sector comparisons, and the evolution of both of them. The main findings are intuitive and greatly align to the factual history. In particular, there exist a “response time lag” for any sector to react to the crisis event. This lag depends on the sectors as well as the regions/ countries where the articles come from. Moreover, the diversity in the contents cross-sectors have been observed before the crisis. Whereas as the crisis affects the world more deeply and widely, a convergence in the discussions relevant to the crisis appear among the sectors.

				    <strong>Coexistence of Undirected and Directed Networks in Goodreads Online Community</strong>
			    </h5>
			    <p> 
				    Goodreads is a large-scale online network. Its following-or-friend setting allows the coexistence of undirected and directed networks. A mixing-network model is built to discuss the efficiency of such network and which network structure tends to appear. The data of Goodreads’ members’ demographic information, list of friends and list of followings has been collected. It covers over 5 million Goodreads members, equivalent to around 8% of total 65 million population. Empirical data shows that the Goodreads network also follows the power-law distribution.

				    <strong>The Impact of Oil Price on Russian Ruble Exchange Rate</strong>
			    </h5>
			    <p>
				    Crude oil plays a critical role in the industrial production and daily transportation. Oil sector accounts for over 68% of Russia’s export in 2013. Between July to December 2014, the negative oil price shock dampens Russia’s exports. This paper, using both West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent (BRNT) oil prices, studies the relationship between oil price and Ruble exchange rate (RUB/USD). It discovers that oil price Granger-causes RUB/USD and not vice versa. This result indicates that oil price is important to the value of Russian currency since the Russian economy heavily depends on the oil sector. Moreover, only long-run conintegration relationship has been observed.
